# Incident Report

## Misleading Paths

- Initially focused on network issues, but no anomalies were found.
- Explored potential DDoS attacks, but traffic patterns were normal.
- Considered server hardware failure, but all system metrics were stable.

## Escalation

- Escalated the incident to the Database Operations team.
- Engaged with the Development team to review and optimize database queries.

## Resolution

- Temporarily increased the database connection pool limit to restore service.
- Identified and optimized poorly performing database queries.
- Implemented a code fix to prevent similar queries from causing future connection pool exhaustion.

## Root Cause and Resolution

### Root Cause

A misconfigured database query caused an excessive number of open connections to the database server. The connection pool was exhausted, leading to a service outage.

### Resolution

- Temporarily increased the database connection pool limit to mitigate the immediate impact.
- Identified and optimized the problematic database queries to reduce resource consumption.
- Deployed a code fix to prevent the misconfiguration of queries and implemented query caching for improved performance.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

### Improvements/Fixes

- Conduct a thorough review of all database queries to identify and optimize potential performance bottlenecks.
- Implement stricter monitoring thresholds for database connection pool usage.
- Enhance logging and alerting mechanisms to quickly detect and respond to similar issues in the future.

### Tasks to Address the Issue

- Patch the application codebase to include the query optimization and caching changes.
- Conduct a comprehensive review of the database schema and indexing to ensure optimal query execution.
- Update the monitoring system to provide more granular insights into database performance.
- Schedule a team-wide training session on best practices for database query optimization and connection management.
